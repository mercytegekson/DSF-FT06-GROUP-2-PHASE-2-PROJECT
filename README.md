The goal of this project is to come up with a linear regression model that will help predict accurate prices of houses by analyzing the features influencing house sale prices in king county and provide actionable insights for the Real estate agency.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a robust regression model for predicting house prices in a specific real estate market, thereby addressing the critical need for accurate and reliable property price estimations. 
By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and predictive modeling, this initiative aims to provide invaluable insights to various stakeholders, including prospective homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and property investors

## Business Understanding
Inadequate pricing models often lead to overpriced properties, resulting in extended time on the market.
Overpricing contributes to prolonged periods of property stagnation and limited buyer interest.
Prospective buyers encounter difficulties in identifying properties that align with their budgetary constraints.
A lack of robust pricing strategies hinders effective decision-making for both sellers and buyers.
Implementing an accurate and efficient housing pricing model can streamline the buying and selling process, enhancing market competitiveness and overall transaction efficiency.
